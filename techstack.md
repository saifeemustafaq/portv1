  - MongoDB Atlas for cloud hosting
  - Mongoose ODM for data modeling
- **Authentication**: 
  - NextAuth.js for authentication flow
  - Bcrypt for password hashing
  - MongoDB for user credentials storage
  - Role-based access control for admin panel
  - Secure session management

## Essential Libraries

  - Zustand for client state (if needed)

- **UI/UX**:
  - Framer Motion for animations
  - React Icons for iconography
  - React Hook Form for form handling

- **Validation & Security**:
  - Zod for schema validation
  - CORS for API security
  - Helmet.js for security headers

## Development Tools
- **Code Quality**:
  - ESLint for linting
  - Prettier for code formatting
  - Husky for git hooks

- **Testing**:
  - Jest for unit testing
  - React Testing Library for component testing
  - Cypress for E2E testing (optional)

## Deployment & Hosting

### Primary Option: Netlify
- **Plan**: Pro Plan ($19/month)
  - Includes:
    - Form handling
    - Identity service for authentication
    - Large Media for image transformation
    - Functions for serverless backend
    - 1TB bandwidth
    - Branch deploys
    - Build plugins
    - Background functions

### Storage Solution
With Netlify's Pro Plan:
- **Netlify Large Media** can handle most image and asset storage needs
- Built on top of Git LFS (Large File Storage)
- Includes on-the-fly image transformations
- No separate cloud storage service needed for basic use cases

### When to Consider Additional Storage (Azure/AWS):
1. If your storage needs exceed Netlify's limits:
   - Large Media files > 5GB
   - Need for specialized file processing
   - Complex CDN requirements

2. If you need:
   - Direct file upload to cloud storage
   - Complex file permissions
   - Specialized media processing

## Development Environment
- **Node.js**: v18.x or higher
- **Package Manager**: pnpm (faster and more efficient)
- **Environment Variables**: 
  - `.env.local` for local development
  - Netlify Environment Variables for production

## CI/CD Pipeline
- **Source Control**: GitHub
- **Deployment**:
  - Automatic deploys via Netlify
  - Branch previews for feature development
  - Deploy previews for pull requests

## Performance Optimization
- **Image Optimization**: 
  - Next.js Image component
  - Netlify Large Media transformations

- **Code Optimization**:
  - Code splitting (built into Next.js)
  - Tree shaking
  - Dynamic imports

## Monitoring & Analytics
- **Error Tracking**: Sentry
- **Analytics**: 
  - Netlify Analytics (server-side)
  - Optional: Plausible Analytics (privacy-focused)

## Cost Breakdown
1. **Netlify Pro**: $19/month
   - Includes most needed services

2. **MongoDB Atlas**: Free tier
   - Sufficient for portfolio website needs
   - Upgrade only if needed ($57+/month)

3. **Domain**: ~$10-15/year
   - Depends on domain registrar and TLD

Total Monthly Cost: Approximately $19 (excluding domain)
