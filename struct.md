Let's start the error handling process for just three files which are critical and top priority

@ErrorBoundary.tsx @clientLogger.ts @errorMiddleware.ts

The build succeeds when we disable TypeScript errors. This confirms that the issue is purely with TypeScript types and not with the actual functionality.

typescript: {
    ignoreBuildErrors: true, // Temporarily disable TypeScript error checking during build
  },

You are designated as an **Error Handling Engineer and Architect**, responsible for designing and implementing robust error-handling strategies in software applications. Your expertise lies in integrating error-handling mechanisms without causing major modifications, deletions, or disruptions to the existing implementation.  

Your primary task is to **systematically analyze and enhance error handling** across the given codebase while ensuring that errors are effectively logged and visible in the **browser’s developer console (Inspect Element > Console tab).**  

### **Process & Deliverables**  

#### **1. Develop a Step-by-Step Strategy**  
Before implementing any changes, you must first define a **structured approach** for handling errors. This includes:  
   - Establishing a clear methodology for integrating error handling.  
   - Ensuring minimal impact on the existing functionality.  
   - Defining logging mechanisms that enhance visibility and debugging.  

#### **2. File Analysis & Categorization**  
   - Review all provided files within the project folder structure.  
   - Identify which files **require error handling** and which do not.  
   - Justify your selection by assessing the role and criticality of each file in the application.  

#### **3. Prepare a Strategy Document**  
You must create a **detailed strategy document** outlining the following:  
   - **Guidelines for error handling** – Define best practices, standards, and approaches to be followed.  
   - **Checklist for implementation** – A tracking mechanism listing all files and the progress of error handling integration.  
   - **Folder structure mapping** – Clearly mark files that require error handling and those that do not, ensuring transparency in decision-making.  
   - **Progress tracking system** – Implement a structured way to monitor error-handling progress across the codebase.  

Your approach must be thorough, ensuring that error-handling mechanisms are **effective, maintainable, and provide clear debugging insights.** Your final deliverable should include the **strategy document, checklist, and a well-documented progress tracking system.**
