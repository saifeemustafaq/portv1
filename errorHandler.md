# Error Handling Implementation Plan

## Execution Instructions and Timeline

### Getting Started
1. **Initial Setup (Week 1)**
   - [x] Review this entire document thoroughly
   - [x] Set up development environment with necessary testing tools
   - [x] Install any required dependencies for error handling and monitoring

2. **Progress Tracking Instructions**
   - Use checkboxes ([ ]) to track implementation status
   - Mark items as completed by changing [ ] to [x]
   - Example: [x] Setup error logging (2024-03-15)
   - Update the Progress Tracking section percentage after completing each phase
   - Add brief implementation notes for completed items
   - Track blockers or dependencies by adding [BLOCKED] prefix to items
   - Example: [BLOCKED] API error handling - waiting for database setup

3. **Progress Review**
   - Move blocked items to top of their respective sections
   - Document any new requirements or changes
   - Update overall progress percentages

### Implementation Order and Dependencies
1. **Core Infrastructure (Weeks 1-2)**
   - [x] Create custom error classes in `lib/errors/CustomErrors.ts`
   - [x] Implement error response formatter in `lib/errors/errorFormatter.ts`
   - [x] Create error middleware in `lib/errors/errorMiddleware.ts`
   - [x] Set up logging infrastructure integration
   
2. **Authentication & API Layer (Weeks 2-3)**
   - [x] Implement error handling in authentication routes:
     - [x] Change password route (`/api/admin/change-password/route.ts`)
   - [x] Add error handling to critical API routes in this order:
     1. [x] Remaining authentication-related routes
        - [x] NextAuth route (`/api/auth/[...nextauth]/route.ts`)
        - [x] Created specialized auth error classes (`lib/errors/AuthErrors.ts`)

     3. [x] Project management routes
     4. [x] Logging routes
        - [x] Enhanced `/api/logs/route.ts` with validation and error handling

3. **Frontend Components (Weeks 3-4)**

   - [x] Keep error messages in a centralized location
   - [x] Document all error codes and their meanings

2. **Testing Requirements**
   - [ ] Write tests before implementing error handling
   - [ ] Maintain minimum 80% test coverage for error handlers
   - [ ] Include both happy path and error path tests

3. **Review Process**
   - [ ] Code review required for each major component
   - [ ] Test all error scenarios before merging
   - [ ] Update documentation as you implement

### Important Notes
- Always start with high-priority items first
